            <h1>Manatees in Art</h1>
            <article>
            <p>Manatees have fascinated and inspired artists for decades. Here's a sample of some of the artwork that has been created for manatees.</p>

                    <p>The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. Native Americans ground the bones to treat asthma and earache. In West African folklore, they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human. Killing one was taboo and required penance.[60]

                            Manatees were featured in the "Cartoon Wars Part II" episode of South Park, as the creative force behind the television show Family Guy. The manatees were shown to be living in a tank at FOX Studios which was filled with "idea balls."</p>

                    <p>The manatees were shown to be living in a tank at FOX Studios which was filled with "idea balls." The manatees randomly selected the idea balls to make the jokes for the show. They are also revealed as being "the only animal unmoved by terrorist threats."[61] The manatee is also pivotal in Lair of the Leviathan, the third episode of the game Tales of Monkey Island, by Telltale Games and Lucasarts.</p>

                    <p>From manatee hides, Native Americans made war shields, canoes, and shoes, though manatees were predominantly hunted for their abundant meat.</p>

                <div class="art-blurb">
                    <p>Later, manatees were hunted for their bones, which were used to make "special potions". Until the 1800s, museums paid as much as $100 for bones or hides. Though hunting was banned in 1893, poaching continues today.</p>
